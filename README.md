    My passion for football goes all way and this led me to look through the world cup data for the years 1930 to 2014, 
    the desire being to learn some history regarding the competition in terms of:
      Host nations
      Participants, 
      Scores and minor details as from the years how the score and ranking were like.



Between the years(1930-2014) below are some of the interesting findings.

  The world cup has been held 21 times between 1930 and 2014 this excludes 2018 competition held in Russia

  The competition has seen 15 different as host nations

  The competition has seen 83 nations feature in the mentioned years

  The competition has seen 8 different nations crowned as winners, with Brazil being the successful nation with 5 trophies 



Worked with a few excel formulas and few lines of VBA scripts to come up the summary. 



Extensively used index and match which are happens to be my favorite when it comes to lookup though VLOOKUP was taken into account



The Count and CountA played a huge role in making the counts, with count if/rows() and VLOOKUP used for purpose of extracting unique values.



Sumproduct is my favorite formula when it comes to filtering data, but one has to understand what they are filtering in order to get the desired results. 

The data is from Tableau website
